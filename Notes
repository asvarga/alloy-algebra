- optimizations
	- only considering generator elements
		- describe graphs as {Elem -> Gen -> Elem} instead of {Elem -> Elem -> Elem}, for smaller relations
	- gruples: tuples representing a products of groups, ex: (Z/2Z)^8
	* product groups (2)

- how can group theory be used to *help* Alloy?
	- have (proven) facts that say if a relation satisfies the group axioms -> it also satisfies xyz
	- hard-wire group-specific symmetry breaking, like in util/ordering
	- maybe just adding it as a fact will work?

- more iso theorems

* ring examples	(1)
	* ring properties/quotients
	* ring iso theorems

- visualization
	- Build descriptive graphs from a group:
		- subgroup lattices
		- Cayley graphs, cycle graphs, etc
	- Might want to customize Alloy's viz
	- Maybe make external GUI to Alloy

- usage examples
	- State-transition puzzles like hamiltonian paths through group
