- Want notions of isomorphism
- maybe add group theorems as *facts* instead of re-*proving*
	- can assist alloy by automatically introducing these facts
- State-transition puzzles like hamiltonian paths through group

- Build other groups or graphs from a group:
	- subgroup lattices
	- Cayley graphs, cycle graphs, etc
	- quotient groups
- Might want to customize Alloy's viz
- Maybe make external GUI to Alloy
