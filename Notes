- speed up everything by only considering generator elements
	- describe graphs as {Elem -> Gen -> Elem} instead of {Elem -> Elem -> Elem}
		- much smaller
- Want notions of isomorphism
- how can group theory be used to *help* Alloy?
	- have (proven) facts that say if a relation satisfies the group axioms -> it also satisfies xyz


- Build other groups or graphs from a group:
	- subgroup lattices
	- Cayley graphs, cycle graphs, etc
	- quotient groups
- Might want to customize Alloy's viz
- Maybe make external GUI to Alloy
- State-transition puzzles like hamiltonian paths through group
